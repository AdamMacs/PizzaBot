# PizzaBot
To run pizza bot open the tar file or just clone the repo at https://github.com/AdamMacs/PizzaBot

cd into your directory where you have cloned the repo

Install ruby 2.4.2 and the bundler gem

Bundle Install

When in the root of the directory type ./pizzabot 

It will run the program with the input "5x5 (0, 0) (1, 3) (4, 4) (4, 2) (4, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) (2, 3) (4, 1)"

I have added some tests using Rspec 

To run these type :

bundle

rspec

Or alternatively you can run the Rake task to run specs:


rake spec
