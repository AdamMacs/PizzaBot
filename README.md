# PizzaBot
To run pizza bot open the tar file or just clone the repo at https://github.com/AdamMacs/PizzaBot

cd into your directory where you have cloned the repo

Install ruby 2.6.6 and the bundler gem "gem install bundler"

Then type "bundle install"

When in the root of the directory type ./pizzabot "5x5 (0, 0) (1, 3) (4, 4) (4, 2) (4, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) (2, 3) (4, 1)"

I have added some tests using Rspec 

To run these type :

rspec

Or alternatively you can run the Rake task to run specs:


rake spec
